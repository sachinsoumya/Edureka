 # JavaScript Codebase Explanation

This codebase demonstrates various concepts in JavaScript, including classes, inheritance, and function overloading. It includes examples of classes like `Animal`, `Bird`, `Teacher`, `Student`, `Cricket`, and `Football`, each with their own constructors and methods.

## Classes and Inheritance

### Animal and Bird Classes

- The `Animal` class has a constructor that takes the number of legs as an argument and a `walk` method that returns a string indicating the number of legs the animal has.

- The `Bird` class extends the `Animal` class and inherits its properties and methods. It also has its own constructor that calls the `Animal` constructor to initialize the number of legs.

### Teacher and Student Classes

- The `Teacher` class has a constructor that takes the teacher's name and school name as arguments and a `getDetails2` method that returns a string with the teacher's name and school name.

- The `Student` class extends the `Teacher` class and inherits its properties and methods. It also has its own constructor that takes the student's name, teacher's name, age, and school name as arguments. It has a `getDetails` method that returns the teacher's name.

## Function Overloading

The `love` function is an example of function overloading. It takes a variable number of arguments and logs them to the console.

## Cricket and Football Classes

- The `Cricket` class has a constructor that takes the team name and captain's name as arguments.

- The `Football` class extends the `Cricket` class and inherits its properties and methods. It also has its own constructor that takes the team name and number of goals scored as arguments.

## Code Snippets

```javascript
// Animal class
function Animal(legs) {
  this.legs = legs;
}

Animal.prototype.walk = function () {
  return "animal has " + this.legs + " legs";
};

// Bird class
function Bird(legs) {
  Animal.call(this, legs);
}

Bird.prototype = Animal.prototype;

// Teacher class
class Teacher {
  constructor(name, schlName) {
    this.tname = name;
    this.schlName = schlName;
  }

  getDetails2() {
    return `${this.tname} is classteacher of ${this
